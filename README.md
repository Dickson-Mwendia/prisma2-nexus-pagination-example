# Repository
This repository was used for demostration purposes to follow the instructional content provided in the [Prisma2/Nexus Pagination Tutorial](https://github.com/chaunceyau/prisma2-nexus-pagination-example/blob/master/Tutorial.md). Please follow the tutorial if you would like to learn more about using the technologies together.

# Quick Run

```
npm install prisma2
git clone https://github.com/chaunceyau/prisma2-nexus-pagination-example.git
cd prisma2-nexus-pagination-example
npm install
npm run start
# prisma2 dev (optional - runs Prisma Studio)
```

Now, you can visit `localhost:4000/graphql` and use the GraphQL playground to experiment with the current demo repo. You can also run `prisma2 dev` to access `Prisma Studio` which gives you an "IDE for your database".
