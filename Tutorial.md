# Understanding Pagination with the Prisma Framework and GraphQL
In this article, you will learn how to **implement pagination** using the [Prisma Framework](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-2-zq1s745db8i5#getting-started-with-prisma-2). You will also cover **two of the most common practices** for paginating data.

If you are unfamiliar with Prisma, we encourage you to **first explore** the [Prisma website](https://www.prisma.io) prior to completing this tutorial. The Prisma Framework is composed of two tools to improve database workflows: **Photon and Lift.** [Photon](https://photonjs.prisma.io) is a **type-safe database access client** and [Lift](https://lift.prisma.io) is powerful **database schema migration** tool. You can read more about the specifics of both tools in the [Prisma 2 Preview blog post](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-2-zq1s745db8i5).

## Introduction to Pagination
**Pagination is a practice of requesting subsets**, or "pages" of data in your applications, allowing client applications to avoid requesting every available record. This will likely improving application performance and reduce the stress on backend servers.

Pagination can come in the form of literal pages of data displayed, as you have likely seen with Google search results. However, it can also be more complex. Twitter/Instagram feeds also used pagination to request subsets of data to handle the "Infinite Scrolling" effect.

There are multiple ways to implement pagination with their own use cases. Two of the most common approaches are **Offset-based** and **Cursor-based** pagination. Both of these approaches typically require providing the **first record** and the **number of records before/after**. The primary difference is selecting the first record by an id - *a cursor* - versus skipping a number of existing records - *an offset*.

### Offset-based Pagination

Using **offset-based** pagination, requests should specify the **number of records to skip** (a.k.a. the offset) and the **number of additional records to fetch**. The number of records after the offset is often called the **count or limit**. Offset-based pagination is often easy to implement, while providing end users the ability to jump between specific pages.

</p>


Two issues to consider when considering offset-based pagination are: **(1)** loss of speed at scale -- database will still read data from the disk --  up to the offset + count and **(2)** it can be unstable to use numerical offset with faster changing data. Imagine the scenario described by the sequence of steps and image below.

<p align="center">
  <img width="453" height="184" src="https://i.imgur.com/6meovfI.png">
</p>

The scenarios above depicts **2 requests** at **different points in time**, from the same client. In this example of pagination, **4 items** are returned **per page**. The 1st request **returns results 1-4** and the 2nd request will **return results 5-8**. Imagine **a new record** is added by a different user **between the 1st and 2nd** request. Now the **original 4th record** will be **5th in the database**, and therefore also **returned in the 2nd request**.

### Cursor-based Pagination

Using the **cursor-based** approach, the request will specify **a unique identifier of the first record** (a.k.a. the cursor). The request should also include a count of records to include. **Cursor-based** solutions tend to be **more flexible** and are the go-to option with **quickly changing data**. The drawbacks include **no concept** of the **total number of pages/results** in the set and the client can no longer **jump to a specific page**.

</p>

In the [step-by-step tutorial below](#FIXME), you will see how simple and quick it is to set up an *API serving paginated data from a live database*. When using Prisma and Nexus, there is out-of-the box support for pagination. The cursor is passed to the query as either the **before** or **after** argument and the number of additional records is passed as the argument **first**.

If you'd like to learn more about cursor vs offset-based pagination, you should [read this blog post](https://slack.engineering/evolving-api-pagination-at-slack-1c1f644f8e12) written by the Slack development team.

## Tutorial
It is time to get hands on and create a functional pagination example using the following technologies: GraphQL, Prisma, Photon/Lift, Nexus, Nexus-Prisma,  and SQLite. Using these technologies, you can get a functional example of pagination running in less than 30 minutes. Here is a high-level overview of the steps that will be envolved in the process.

1. [Install the Prisma Framework](#1-install-prisma-framework)
2. [Initialize Prisma Project and NPM Project](#2-initialize-prisma-project-and-npm-project)
3. [Add Project Scripts and Install Dependencies](#3-add-project-scripts-and-install-dependencies)
4. [Create Apollo Server and Photon Client](#4-create-apollo-server-and-photon-client)
5. [Creating & Exposing Schema using GraphQL Nexus](#5-creating--exposing-schema-using-graphql-nexus)
6. [Database migration using Lift](#6-database-migration-using-lift)

### 1. Install Prisma Framework

This will install the Prisma Framework globally on your local machine, providing a CLI for initializing Prisma applications.

```
npm install prisma2 -g
```

### 2. Initialize Prisma Project and NPM Project
In your project directory, run the command below -- *following the prompt options listed* -- which will initialize a project using the Prisma Framework. After the following the prompts, you should now have a directory called *pagination-example* with a *prisma* folder inside.
```
npx prisma2 init pagination-example
  - blank project
  - SQLite
  - include photon and lift -> confirm
  - JavaScript - feel free to use TypeScript 
  - Just the prisma schema
```

You will create package.json for your project via running `npm init -y` inside of the *pagination-example* directory. This will allow you to add scripts and dependencies to the project.

```
cd pagination-example
npm init -y
```

### 3. Add Project Scripts and Install Dependencies

In package.json, you need to add to scripts to run your server and a posinstall hook to generate the database schema.

```js
"dev": "node ./index.js",
"postinstall": "prisma2 generate"
```

Next, you need to install the dependencies required in this project. The **prisma2** package provides **Photon** -- type-safe data access client and **Lift** -- handles database migrations. **nexus-prisma** also provides out-of-the-box support for features like **pagination, ordering and sorting** - as well as the ability to make use of `t.model/t.crud`, which can help making it **quick and easy to expose types**.


```
npm install prisma2 --save-dev        # photon & lift
npm install express                   # standard node.js server
npm install apollo-server-express     # standard graphql express server
npm install nexus                     # code-first graphql schema creation
npm install nexus-prisma              # bindings for nexus & prisma
npm install graphql                   # required peer dependency
```
You should notice this probably unfamiliar line print in the console: *"Downloading darwin binary for query-engine and migration-engine"*. This is the postinstallation hook running and generating the Photon client.

### 4. Create Apollo Server and Photon Client
You will start by creating standard apollo server with no special functionality added yet. Typically you would provide schema's typeDefs and resolvers -- as template literals -- to the ApolloServer constructor, but this example uses GraphQL Nexus and to create the schema -- which you will do in the next step.

```js
// index.js
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express');
const { Photon } = require('@generated/photon')

// photon client
const photon = new Photon()

// you will add GraphQL Nexus schema here in next step

const server = new ApolloServer({ });

const app = express();
server.applyMiddleware({ app });

app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =>
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`)
);
```
        
### 5. Creating & Exposing Schema using GraphQL Nexus
You can now start building your schema using nexus, which allows us to create our code-first -- rather than defining our entire schema upfront using SDL. Start with the required imports from nexus -- to create your GraphQL types & schema, as well as nexus-prisma -- providing the bindings between nexus & prisma. **Nexus-prisma** also allows us to us `t.model/t.crud` later and provides out-of-the box pagination, filtering & sorting.

```js
// 1. imports - index.js
const { objectType, queryType, makeSchema } = require("nexus")
const { nexusPrismaPlugin } = require('nexus-prisma')
const { join } = require('path')
```
      
Next, add the types you wish to expose in your API. This is similar to the typeDefs used in a standard Apollo Server without Nexus. The first two items created below is an *objectType* for both User and Post. This exposes these fields from your database.

```js 
// 2. user/post type - index.js
const User = objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) { t.model.id(), t.model.email() }
})
const Post = objectType({
  name: 'Post',
  definition(t) { t.model.id(), t.model.title(), t.model.author() }
})
```

Next, create a root Query using *queryType* -- to start exposing queries -- beginning with the posts query. Thanks to Photon and Nexus-Prisma, you have out-of-the-box for pagination and can easily implement it using the *before/last or after/first* arguments.

```js 
// 3. query type - index.js
const Query = queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.crud.posts({
      alias: 'posts',
      pagination: true
    })
  }
});
```

Next, you create a schema using *makeSchema*, which includes your types, the nexus-prisma plugin and an outputs object.
```js
// 4. create schema - index.js
const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [Query, User, Post],
  plugins: [nexusPrismaPlugin()],
  outputs: {
    typegen: join(
      __dirname,
      '../node_modules/@types/nexus-typegen/index.d.ts',
    ),
  },
});
```

Finally, you need to update the ApolloServer constructor to include the schema and photon instance.

```js
// 5. pass schema/photon - index.js
const server = new ApolloServer({ schema, context: { photon } })
```

### 6. Database Migration using Lift
The last step is to apply our database migration using Lift to actually setup the SQLite database. **First,** you need to run `prisma2 lift save` to prepare our migration. Terminal will prompt for a name for the migration, which is up to you! After you name the migration, you need to actually apply the changes to our database. To do this, you run `prisma2 lift up` and our database will be up-to-date. Now you can test our queries by running our ApolloServer and use GraphQL playground! 

You will also need to seed your database with some post records one of two ways:
* **manually** using Prisma Studio, which can be thought of as an *IDE to your database*, providing a web-based interface to handle the data in the database. You can run access Prisma Studio by running `prisma2 dev` in the *root project directory* and visting the output url -- localhost:5555 by default. 
* **programmatically** by running a function in apollo-server that *creates the records* from the photon client.
&nbsp;

```js
// programmatically
async function seedDb() {
  try {
    // create a user
    const user = await photon.users.create({
      data: {
        email: 'alicde4sc@f43prisma.io',
        name: 'alice',
      }
    })
    // create a post
    const post_1 = await photon.posts.create({
      data: {
        title: 'Example Post 1',
        author: { connect: { id: user.id } }, published: true
      },
    })
    // ...should create a few more posts
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
}
```

### Complete - Working Pagination
Time to test what you've built! You can now use the GraphQL playground tool at the address of your running Apollo Server to test your query. In the example below, the commented out posts represent the entire dataset -- while the paginated results are requesting by providing an **after** and **first** argument to the query.

## Wrap Up
Hopefully this provided an overview of the simplicity and power of the Prisma Framework. With the auto-generated photon client, developers can add pagination to a project very quickly. Nexus provides a very powerful, "code-first approach" to schema development. If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments and we will hope to help clarify and issues you have!
